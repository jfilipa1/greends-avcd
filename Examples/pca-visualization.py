# which is used to render interactive graphs amd dcc.slider to render an interactive slider).
# We also import sklearn.decomposition.PCA to run a PCA, the plotly.express library to build the interactive graphs, 
# and pandas to work with DataFrames.

# normally contained within a html.Div.

# Add controls to build the interaction
# The inputs and outputs of our app are the properties of a particular component. 
# The output is the figure property of the component with the ID "pca-visualization-x-graph"
# THe input is the value property of the component that has the ID "pca-visualization-x-slider".
# The callback function's argument 'n_components' refers to the component property of the input. 
# We build PCA plots inside the callback function, assigning the chosen value in the slider. 
# This means that every time the user selects the number of components with the slider, the figure is rebuilt
# to add more or less components
# Finally, we return the scatter plots at the end of the function. 
# This assigns the plots to the figure property of the dcc.Graph, thus displaying the figure in the app.
