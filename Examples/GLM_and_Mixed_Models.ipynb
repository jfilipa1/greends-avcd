    "Linear Mixed Effects models are used in regression analyses for study designs in which multiple observations are made on each ubject and therefore there might be a lack of independence among observations. As an example we will use the Iris dataset, used before as an example for simple regression analysis. In this example we found that the overall effect of petal_width on sepal_length was negative, but that considering each species separately, the relationship was inverted.\n",

    "Logistic regression is a Generalized Linear Model of the binomial family. It is suitable either for binary data (yes/no) or for proportions of a given event. It uses the logit link function to model the linear predictor. To predict values in the scale of the response (values between 0 and 1), the inverse of the link function is applied to the linear predictor. The predicted values will be the probability of the event to occur. The parameters are usually estimated using a maximum likelihood estimation approach.\n",
